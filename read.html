   <h2 align="center">About Our Orphanage </h2>
   <p>Shri. Kumar Yash Raj and Dr. Subhashree Tripathy, started KIZI SEVASHRAM in 1945 with just
      3 kids and with the blessings of Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh. More popularly known as "KIZI SEVASHRAM/Orphanage/Gurukulam", the organization has grown to be a very well known and well recognized social
      institution in the country today.</p>

      <p>KIZI SEVASHRAM is a national awardee non-profit organisation with the primary objective of
      protecting orphans, destitute women, children with special needs, and the elderly. KIZI SEVASHRAM
      is based near Bhubaneswar with more than 75 years of recorded services to thousands of poor orphans consistently
      providing them not just food, education and shelter, but also instilling morals to help our children grow, learn
      and eventually become independent. KIZI SEVASHRAM is providing a hygienic environment, balanced
      nutritious food, clothing, shelter, education, morals, basic family values, culture, and above all the true value
      of love and affection for more than seven decades. One of the major advantages of KIZI SEVASHRAM
      is that all children have the support of the senior citizens who themselves are neglected by their kith and kin.
      In return, the senior citizens get love and affection from the tiny tots when they need it the most. KIZI SEVASHRAM runs accredited primary and high schools, which benefit the orphans and thousands of rural
      children in about 50 villages in this area. In addition to taking care of the physical health by having Doctors,
      Nurses, and Ayas to support thousands of human beings within its premises, KIZI SEVASHRAM also
      take cares of mental health needs such as counselling, outdoor activities, keeping the environment clean with
      greenery and so on thereby resulting in upbeat perspective of life for everyone.

      Many, including former Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, former Chief Minister of Odisha
      Mr. Navin Patnayak, Governors, Ministers, Judges, Social Workers, Leading
      Industrialists, Art/Cine & other achievers have visited our Gurukulam and witnessed our committed work. Here
      (click here) are a few sample testimonials and photos from our archives. For more, please visit our Gallery and
      Testimonials pages to experience their personal visits to our organization. We find that these children feel very
      special to meet such dignitaries and such personal visit induces self-confidence in them to come up in life.
